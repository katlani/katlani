# Grammar
- Verb always goes at the start of the main clause
- The rest of the main clause can be any of the following components, in any order:
    - Tense marker
        - One of:
            - `ni` - present
            - `pas` - past
            - `fy` - future
        - Maximum one tense marker per main clause
        - Can be omitted and inferred from context (if the whole story is in past tense, it's unlikely to change). With no context, generally assumed to be present-tense
        - Normally goes directly after the verb
    - Adverbs
        - Some adverbs are words on their own
        - Other adverbs are formed with the particle `li`, which prefixes a word (typically an adjective) to convert it to an adverb
    - Noun phrases, composed of (in order):
        - First, an optional case marker:
            - `ta` - subject (accusative). Should be used to disambiguate only as necessary
            - `su` - direct object
            - `lia` - indirect object
            - `my` - genitive (see below for possessives)
            - If there is no case marker, it is presumed to be accusative
        - The noun itself
            - Pluralisation ending:
                - None for singular
                - `i` for a few
                - `ii` for many
                - `iii` for *too* many
        - Adjectives
        - Optionally, if the noun is the possessee:
            - Another noun phrase representing the possessor; its case marker must be `my`
 ## Tips
 
 If you want to say one thing is another, you use si [thing1] su [thing2]
